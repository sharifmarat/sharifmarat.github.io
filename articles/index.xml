      <title>Improved way to run cron</title>
      <link>http://sharifmarat.github.io/articles/longwarn/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Systemd timers is an interesting alternative, but I still prefer &lt;code&gt;crontab&lt;/code&gt; over it to run periodic jobs on my servers.
To make it a bit more reliable I just chain a few commands like &lt;code&gt;cronic&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;longwarn&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Generate gallery from Nextcloud tagged images</title>

      <guid>http://sharifmarat.github.io/articles/gallery_generator_nextcloud_tags/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I could not find a way to share or publish tagged Nextcloud images. This seems like a useful feature
in which you can share all images of a person with them. There are a few feature requests on Nextcloud GitHub,
but Nextcloud 21 still does not implement it. I wrote a small shell script to make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alternative to Remote Console</title>
      <link>http://sharifmarat.github.io/articles/remote_console_alternative/</link>

      <guid>http://sharifmarat.github.io/articles/remote_console_alternative/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not all hosting providers offer a free remote console. It makes it difficult to debug certain issues with grub,
especially when LUKS and/or LVM is used. Rescue mode, on the other hand, is offered. That
removes the need for a remote console in most of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Firefox started to throw an error on some sites that a page was not redirecting properly.
On the internet, people gave recommendations to clear the browser cache and cookies, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t help me.
It turned out that the issue was quite different, but simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dual Intel and Nvidia graphics on Void Linux</title>
      <link>http://sharifmarat.github.io/articles/void_optimus_nvidia_intel/</link>

      <guid>http://sharifmarat.github.io/articles/void_optimus_nvidia_intel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Optimus technology allows seamlessly switch between two graphics cards on a laptop.
An Intel integrated card is used to safe battery life when performance is not needed.
A discrete Nvidia card is turned on for certain applications, like games, mining.
It was a big tricky to setup dual graphics on Void Linux. A few hints below could help you to take advantage
of this technology on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial explains how to connect Gravity UART MH-Z16 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensor from DFRobot to Raspberry Pi
and get CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; readings.
This is a nice NDIR-sensor with a wide range, up to 50000 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

showed how to lock the screen when closing a laptop lid on Void Linux. It required to know a user under which the
&lt;code&gt;mate-session&lt;/code&gt; was started. Default ACPI script in Void Linux does not detect correct user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Void Linux is an amazing operating system which reminded me FreeBSD in Linux world. Many parts were built from scratch,
like runit for init scripts, xbps for package management. And they are minimalistic which makes it
even better. Void uses rolling release to delivers fresh packages on regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine (let&amp;rsquo;s call him D.) asked if I could help his nephew V. with English essay. He studies in middle school in Russia.
It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time V. did not do his homework. I recommended to copy some examples from google.
It would be at least more useful for him rather than doing nothing. But he said that schoold checks homework for plagiarism. What?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Map matching is an interesting problem which is used in car navigation,

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all began, as usual, with a simple yes or no question on how to loop in C++.
Which led to &lt;code&gt;size_type&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;size_t&lt;/code&gt; discussion and ended with a joke and a bit of assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eneco is one of the biggest energy company in the Netherlands. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using their services
for quite some time. It was alright except phone calls from private numbers with offers to
renew a contract (I bet there is a better way to do it). But recently they sent me a bill
which questions competency of their workers and the company in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation&#34;&gt;From wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: In physics, chemistry and materials science, percolation
refers to the movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials.
Original problem was described by Broadbent and Hammersley in 1957:
Will the water reach the center of the porous rock when it is submerged under water?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You just finished setting up your MX server and everything works fine.
And now you are wondering whether you need a secondary MX server for backups.
Some would say that these days you actually don&amp;rsquo;t need a secondary MX server,
because MTAs (mail transfer agent) queue mail if MX server is down.
In addition a secondary MX server might be abused by spammers.
But just for fun, let&amp;rsquo;s assume you want to have a backup MX server.
And you are lucky enough to have a friend who also runs an MX server which he is willing
to configure as your backup server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a transmission client running on Raspberry Pi 3. But what I also wanted is to have
a simple way to check the status of this client with a simple glance.
Raspberry Pi 3 has multiple LEDs on-board.
Luckily, one of them can be easily controlled from a user space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a language course designed in France that uses a language known to you to teach you a target language.
Creators claim that you can acquire an average vocabulary of a few thousands words,
gain a command of everyday conversation and reach B2 level in a few months.
I am going to try it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have got &lt;strong&gt;Comtrend VI-3223u&lt;/strong&gt; router from my ISP. Unfortunaly they do not give you full access to this router.
Recently I have discovered that with limited access you cannot do even simple things like configuring static IP address
in DHCP or setting up parental control. If you are interested how to get full access for this router then this article is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
